# Multi-Face Attendance System using Deep Learning

## Description
A deep learning–based system that detects and recognizes multiple faces simultaneously from images or video streams to automate attendance marking. Designed as a modular backend that can be integrated with external web or mobile applications.

## Libraries Used
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- OS / Pathlib  

## Base Path Configuration
The project uses a base path for accessing models, datasets, and outputs.  
After cloning the repository, update the base path according to your local machine.
You may use os.getcwd() python function.clear

Example (Windows):
```python
BASE_DIR = r"C:\Users\yanko\OneDrive\Desktop\Desktop Files\present-me\colleges"
